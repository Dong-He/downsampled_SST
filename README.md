# downsampled_SST
A fast implementation of synchrosqueezing transform (SST) based on downsampling scheme (also known as downsampling-based SST or fast SST). 
The codes are designed for large scale vibrational data analysis.

We would be grateful if scientific publications resulting from downsampled SST would cite our work properly.

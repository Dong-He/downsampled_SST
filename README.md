# downsampled_SST
A fast implementation of synchrosqueezing transform (SST) based on downsampling scheme (also known as downsampling-based SST or fast SST). 
The codes are designed for large scale vibrational data analysis.

We would be grateful if scientific publications resulting from TSST would cite our work properly.
